## Features

- **Real-time 3D Sculpting**: Add, subtract, push, offset, and extrude mesh surfaces with dynamic subdivision
- **Multiple Primitive Shapes**: Start with spheres, cubes, cylinders, cones, and torus shapes
- **Advanced Mesh Manipulation**:
  - Symmetric subdivision for smooth surface refinement
  - Adaptive tessellation based on brush proximity
  - Real-time geometry updates with optimized performance
- **Clinical Measurement Overlay**:
  - Volume, dimensions, and orientation angles in clinician-friendly units
  - Configurable unit scale (mm per scene unit)
- **Professional Tools**:
  - Sculpting brushes (add, subtract, push)
  - Transform tools (move, scale, rotate)
  - Selection and multi-object support
  - Undo/redo functionality
- **Interactive 3D Viewport**:
  - Orbit controls for camera navigation
  - Grid and axis helpers
  - Real-time brush preview
  - Dynamic tool strength adjustment

## Technologies Used

- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Three.js** for 3D rendering
- **@react-three/fiber** for React-Three.js integration
- **@react-three/drei** for 3D helpers and controls
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **Vitest** for testing

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sculpt-3D.git
cd sculpt-3D
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## Usage

### Basic Controls

- **Left Mouse**: Apply current tool (when clicking on objects)
- **Middle Mouse / Right Mouse**: Rotate view
- **Scroll**: Zoom in/out
- **Right Mouse**: Pan view

### Tools

- **Add Primitive**: Click the primitive buttons to add new shapes to the scene
- **Sculpt Mode**:
  - **Add**: Click and drag to add material
  - **Subtract**: Click and drag to remove material
  - **Push**: Click and drag to push/pull surfaces
  - **Offset**: Click and drag to offset surface normals with clinician-defined depth (mm)
  - **Extrude**: Click and drag to extrude or inset regions by depth (mm)
- **Measure**: Click two points on the mesh to measure distance
- **Transform Mode**:
  - **Move**: Click and drag to move objects
  - **Scale**: Click and drag to scale objects
  - **Rotate**: Click and drag to rotate objects
- **Select**: Click to select objects for editing

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Ctrl/Cmd + Z**: Undo
- **Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Z**: Redo
- **Delete**: Remove selected object

### Key Components

- **ModelingCanvas**: Main 3D viewport with camera and controls
- **SceneObject**: Manages individual 3D objects and sculpting interactions
- **SculptingEngine**: Core sculpting algorithms and mesh manipulation
- **Scene**: Manages the overall 3D scene and object collection

## Architecture Highlights

- **Optimized Rendering**: Uses React Three Fiber for efficient React-Three.js integration
- **Geometry Versioning**: Prevents race conditions during rapid sculpting operations
- **Symmetric Subdivision**: Custom algorithm for smooth mesh refinement
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of Three.js resources and geometries
